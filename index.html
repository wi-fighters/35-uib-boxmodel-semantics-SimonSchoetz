            <p>
                Every musical recording has two major aspects we have to take into account: a <b>frequency range</b> and
                the <b>dynamics</b> of the recorded signal. Both aspects have boundaries, determined by physics and
                evolution.<br>
                The interesting frequency range for us humans is roughly between 20Hz and 20000Hz. While
                maybe only babies have the ability to actually hear the whole spectrum &lpar;while getting older, the
                frequency range is getting less, especially in the high frequencies&rpar;, the music society agreed to
                stick to this parameters.<br>
                The dynamics describe the differences between the quiet and the loud parts within the signal.
                Technically described, the boundaries for this aspect are a ceil, determined as 0db. Everything above
                0db breaks a threshold where the signal will start to distort. In the analog world, this is even used to
                <i>colorize</i> the sound due to the characteristics of the device. In the digital world on the other
                hand, the distortion instantly is at 100% and results in total destruction of the sound. You can think
                of a waveform which is pushed against a ceiling and is getting squared - this is exactly what happens.
                The bottom end is determined by the device you are using and is basically its own <b>noise floor</b>.
                This is basically white noise introduced by the electronics of your recording/mixing device. If you
                listen to old recordings, the white noise you hear is the noise floor of the old and technically not
                that good <i>signal to noise ratios</i> from back in the days. When the noise floor is louder than your
                recorded signal, you reached bottom end. Nowadays, you can go veeeery low, easily over -100db. To give
                you a hint of what this means: if you give any signal a gain of +6db, it is twice as loud.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dynamic aspect is our main problem to solve when it comes to mixing. Imagine a living room and you
                have to fill it with furnishings. You have to fit in a couch, a TV, a table, a carpet, a shelf and maybe
                a couple things more. You can decide how big this pieces should be but you only have so much space and
                trading space for a big TV with a small couch might be a poor choice. When it comes to music, we decide
                how loud a signal &lpar;e. g. a certain instrument&rpar; should be compared to the others. And we also
                decide in which frequency range it should be louder than others. And also when. When we go back to
                living room analogy, we decide, which elements should be in the front and which elements are better off
                in the background.

            <h2 id="eqing">EQing</h2>
            <p>
                With an EQ or <b>equalizer</b>, we can work on the frequency spectrum. We can boost important parts and
                cut unimportant areas to make space for elements, where have their strength in this area. A female
                singer for example doesn't need anything below ~150Hz and might be overrepresented at around 2500Hz,
                because this is, where our ears are very sensitive because evolution made us hear humans voices better.
                But it might need a boost at maybe 5000Hz and above to give it more presence and bring it more upfront.
                Every instrument and signal has these areas and if several signals have the same requirements, we have
                to decide which element is when more important. Placing your couch and your favorite chair on the same
                spot doesn't work. One has be either in the front or in the back or you place them next to each other
                but then none of these places have the perfect spot to watch tv.

            <h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
            <p>
                Compression is helping us to make signals louder without hitting our heads at 0db. Every signal has an
                overall dynamic which is also called <b>loudness</b>. The human voice is a very dynamic signal. Even a
                loud sung vocal part has many, very quiet parts in it. We can scream very loud but can't really scream a
                "s" or "f" for example. This is, where compression comes into place. With this tool, when can make parts
                of a signal less loud, when it reaches a certain threshold. For example: we can say everything over
                -12db should be only half as loud. Therefore, our maximum peak should be at -6db and thus, we can turn
                up the whole signal by +6db and made the overall loudness twice as loud as before. <br>
                This also is helping us to keep overlapping signals in place. Imagine your couch and your chair on the
                same spot again and you have a device that squeezes the chair into the couch. Both is still there, ind
                this case maybe a bit drastically but you kinda can sit on both of them now.

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion or the short answer</h2>
            <p>
                Sooo: Mixing is shuffling your sound signals to make them all fit under the <i>"ceil"</i> of 0db. You
                have tools to work on two major aspects: The frequency range and the dynamics.
